They do this using their gills.1ï»¿ Water enters the fish's mouth and then the fish forces water across its gills, past many tiny blood vessels, and out the gill slits. The gills take oxygen from the water and let water whisk away carbon dioxide and ammonia from the blood vessels in the gills. Gill filaments are the red, fleshy part of the gills; they take oxygen into the blood. Each filament has thousands of fine branches (lamellae) that are exposed to the water. The branches contain blood capillaries beneath a thin epithelium that separates the blood from the water, allowing oxygen and carbon dioxide to pass through easily."}]
